ParkUF Server Application

The server code for the ParkUF project for Mobile Computing.  The project is an Android application 
used to keep track of available parking spots in various University of Florida parking lots.  The app connects to a server
which connects to IR sensors that are placed at the entrance/exit of a parking lot.  When a vehicle enters or exits the parking
lot the server recieves a signal and increments or decrements the number of remaining parking spots available.  The app
then retrieves the parking information every 30 seconds and displays it for the user.
